# Connect Securely to Serverless Tier Clusters

This document introduces the core information about TLS in TiDB Serverless Tier.

## How do I connect to TiDB Serverless in TLS connection?

TiDB Cloud provides some connection examples in the **Connect** tab.

Generally, you should enable TLS and offer a CA root path to authenticate the server, that will help you prevent a man-in-the-middle attack. Different clients have different operations in the TLS connection. Please, according to your actual use of the client, do accordingly with two criteria, enable TLS and verify the server.

## Can I disable TLS in Serverless?

No.

Serverless clusters should only allow TLS connections and reject normal connections. The vital cause is users connecting serverless clusters through a public network, so communication security is really important.

## What TLS versions can I use?

TiDB Serverless only supports TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3. TiDB Serverless uses TLSv1.2 as the default, and you can specify the TLS version in connection strings. For example, If you use MySQL Client to connect TiDB Serverless, you can set `--tls-version=TLSv1.3` to enforce the TLSv1.3 version.

TiDB Serverless does not allow you to manually use TLSv1.0 or TLSv1.2.

## What certificates do I needï¼Ÿ

TiDB Serverless uses certificates from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) as a Certificate Authority (CA) for TLS connection between clients and TiDB Serverless gateway. Usually, Let's Encrypt's root certificate is present in your system's root CA stores. You can easily connect securely to TiDB Serverless without specifying the path of CA roots, such as JAVA, Go, etc.

However, some drivers and ORMs do not use system root CA stores. So you should make sure to add Let's Encrypt's root Certificate Authority( [ISRG Root X1](https://letsencrypt.org/certs/isrgrootx1.pem.txt) ) to your drivers' or ORMs' certificate store.

## Where is the CA root path in my system?

Here gives some CA root paths in the different platforms.

**MacOS**

```
/etc/ssl/cert.pem
```

**Debian / Ubuntu / Arch**
```
/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
```

**RedHat / Fedora / CentOS / Mageia / Vercel / Netlify**

```
/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
```

**Alpine**

```
/etc/ssl/cert.pem
```

**OpenSUSE**

```
/etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem
```

## Can TiDB Serverless verify the client's identity?

No.

Now, TiDB Serverless uses one-sided TLS authentication, which means the server uses the public certificate pair to verify identity while the client can not. The client uses a username and password to authenticate itself. For example, when you use MySQL Client, you should not config `--ssl-cert` and `--ssl-key` in connection strings.
